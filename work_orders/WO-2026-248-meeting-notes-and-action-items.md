## Notes

The meeting agent should be able to:
1. Save notes on-demand ("note that we decided to prioritize the voice module")
2. Create action items from discussion ("create a work order for the API refactor")
3. Auto-generate a post-meeting summary when the meeting ends

Notes and action items should be stored as PCC communications or WOs so they're visible in the existing UI.
