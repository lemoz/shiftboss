## Notes

Future enhancement. Design for it in the connector service (WO-2026-246) but don't implement until audio-only is working well.

Video pipeline:
```
Recall.ai Output Media API renders a web page as bot camera/screenshare
  → PCC dashboard, project kanban, live meeting notes displayed to participants
  → Web page receives meeting audio + transcripts via WebSocket, updates reactively
```
