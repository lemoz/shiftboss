title: Builder Iteration on Test Failures
goal: When tests fail during a builder run, feed the test output back to the builder for another iteration instead of immediately stopping. The builder should iterate until tests pass or max iterations are reached.
context:
  - server/runner_agent.ts (current runner implementation with builder/reviewer loop)
  - server/db.ts (run tracking and status)
  - app/runs/[id]/RunDetails.tsx (run details UI)
acceptance_criteria:
  - When tests fail, capture full test output (stdout + stderr)
  - Feed test failure output back to builder as context for next iteration
  - Builder prompt includes previous test failure output and iteration count
  - Track iteration count (builder_iteration 1, 2, 3...) in runs table
  - Configurable max iterations before giving up (default 3) via settings
  - Only proceed to reviewer when tests pass
  - If max iterations reached without passing, mark run as failed with all iteration history
  - Run details UI shows iteration history (what was tried, what failed)
non_goals:
  - Reviewer iteration on test failures (reviewer is for code quality, not test fixing)
  - Automatic test generation
  - Flaky test detection/retry
stop_conditions:
  - If iteration causes infinite loops or runaway costs, cap strictly and fail gracefully
  - If test output is too large to fit in context, truncate intelligently (last N lines of failure)

# Builder Iteration on Test Failures

## Goal
When tests fail during a builder run, feed the test output back to the builder for another iteration instead of immediately stopping. The builder should iterate until tests pass or max iterations are reached.

## Context
- Current flow: Builder → Tests → (fail) → STOP
- Problem: Valuable test failure output is lost; builder never gets a chance to fix
- WO-2026-020 run failed on tests but could have self-corrected with iteration
- This is foundational for autonomous operation

Current runner flow in `server/runner_agent.ts`:
- Builder produces code
- Tests run via `npm run build && npm test`
- If tests fail, run status → "failed"
- Reviewer never sees it, builder never retries

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] When tests fail, capture full test output (stdout + stderr)
- [ ] Feed test failure output back to builder as context for next iteration
- [ ] Builder prompt includes: "Tests failed with the following output: [output]. Fix the issues and try again."
- [ ] Track iteration count (builder_iteration: 1, 2, 3...)
- [ ] Configurable max iterations before giving up (default: 3)
- [ ] Only proceed to reviewer when tests pass
- [ ] If max iterations reached without passing, mark run as "failed" with all iteration history
- [ ] Run details UI shows iteration history (what was tried, what failed)

## Non-Goals
- Reviewer iteration on test failures (reviewer is for code quality, not test fixing)
- Automatic test generation
- Flaky test detection/retry

## Stop Conditions
- If iteration causes infinite loops or runaway costs, cap strictly and fail gracefully
- If test output is too large to fit in context, truncate intelligently (last N lines of failure)

## CRITICAL: Code Quality Requirements

**IMPORTANT**: Before submitting any code changes:
1. **Ensure ALL imports are present** - If you use a function like `appendLog`, `writeJson`, `ensureDir`, etc., verify it is imported at the top of the file
2. **Check existing imports** - Look at what's already imported in the file and use those patterns
3. **Run TypeScript mentally** - Would `tsc` pass? Are all types correct?
4. **Common imports in runner_agent.ts**: `appendLog`, `writeJson`, `readJson`, `ensureDir` come from `./utils`

Previous runs failed because `appendLog` was used without being imported. This is unacceptable.

## Technical Notes

### New flow:
```
Builder (iteration 1)
  → Build + Test
  → If fail: capture output, increment iteration, loop back to Builder
  → If pass: proceed to Reviewer
  → If max iterations: fail with history
```

### Changes needed:
1. `runner_agent.ts`: Add iteration loop around builder step
2. `runner_agent.ts`: Capture and format test output for builder context
3. `db.ts`: Track `builder_iterations` on runs table
4. `RunDetails.tsx`: Show iteration history in UI
5. Settings: Add `CONTROL_CENTER_MAX_BUILDER_ITERATIONS` (default 3)

### Builder prompt addition:
```
## Previous Attempt Failed

Your previous implementation failed tests. Here's the output:

```
[test output here]
```

Please analyze the failure and fix the issues. This is iteration {n} of {max}.
```
