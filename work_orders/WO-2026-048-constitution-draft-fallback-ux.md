## Problem

When generating a constitution draft, if the AI omits existing content, the system correctly falls back to local merge. However, the current messaging looks like an error:

```
AI draft omitted existing content; falling back to local merge.
Falling back to local draft merge.
```

This is displayed in yellow/warning style, making users think something went wrong when it's actually working correctly.

## Solution

Update the messaging to be positive and informative:

**Before:**
- Yellow/warning styling
- "AI draft omitted existing content; falling back to local merge"
- Sounds like a failure

**After:**
- Neutral or success styling (blue info or green)
- "Preserving your existing content while adding new insights"
- Sounds like intended behavior

## Files to modify

- `app/components/ConstitutionGenerationWizard.tsx` - Update the fallback message and styling
