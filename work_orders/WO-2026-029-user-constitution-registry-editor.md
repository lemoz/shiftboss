title: User constitution registry + editor
goal: Create a versioned user constitution (preferences, decision rules, constraints) per project with a global fallback.
context:
  - DECISIONS.md (governance + local-first)
  - server/db.ts (schema)
  - app/projects/[id]/page.tsx (project UI)
  - app/settings/page.tsx (global settings UI)
acceptance_criteria:
  - Add storage for constitution versions with scope (global or project), statements list, source, created_at, active flag.
  - API endpoints return the active constitution (with global fallback), list versions, and create a new version.
  - UI provides a Constitution panel on project pages and in Settings; editing creates a new version and shows history.
  - Project-specific constitution overrides global; UI shows both.
  - Active constitution is exposed to the Work Order generator.
non_goals:
  - Automatic inference or extraction.
  - Enforcing constitution in agent prompts.
stop_conditions:
  - If statement schema becomes complex, start with a plain list of strings and versioning only.
